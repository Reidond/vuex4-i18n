# Introduction

We are big fans of the awesome vue, vuex and vue-router libraries and were just
looking for an easy to use internationalization plugin, employing as much of
the "standard library" as possible.

The main difference to other internationalization plugins is the ease of use
and support for locales directly with the application or later from the server.
